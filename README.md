# Team Developer

## Description 
I have created a javascript page that will compile the info for new team members added into the workplace. All employees will be prompted to enter their information including their name, employee ID number, and their email address. The Managers will need to enter their office number, Engineers will need to supply their GitHub username, and Interns will be asked to enter the name of the school they attend. This information is then compiled into an html file named "team.html". When you open the html in a browser, it will have all of the information entered.

## Usage
To use this, you must fork the file and run "npm install" in your terminal. This should also install jest and inquirer. Open the app.js in your terminal and enter "node app.js" to begin answering the questions. Once you have finished entering, you will choose the "I am done entering" during the "nextQuestion" prompt function. 

## Installation
npm install
May also need to install inquirer and jest, but should be supplied in the package.json files

## Problems I Faced
Once I knew where to start, the assignment was rather straight forward. I created the employees in their corresponding folders and had the app.js prompt the questions for the user. I did have a little trouble with switch statements and getting my employee questions to prompt, but it was a small error that was fixed easily. 

## Technologies Used
I primarily used Node and JavaScript. While I did have html files, these were pre-generated for us.
